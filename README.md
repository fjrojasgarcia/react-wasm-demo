# Rust/React/Typescript Demo
This is a simple demo using WebAssembly (from Rust) alongside React and Typescript. I was curious to see for myself the difference in performing large operations between WebAssembly and native JavaScript in the browser.

## Building
`$ npm run build`

**Note:** In order to build this app you'll need to have rustify's dependencies installed. Please view the installation [instructions](https://github.com/browserify/rustify#installation) for rustify before building this demonstration for yourself.
